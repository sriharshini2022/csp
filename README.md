#From Prescription to Disposal: Managing Unused Medications
I am  developing a digital tool to recommend the safest, most environmentally-responsible ways to dispose of different medications. This prototype system analyzes the chemical composition of drugs, whether over-the-counter or prescription. Based on the ingredient details, our digital pharmacist can provide tailored disposal guidance. It may suggest taking the item to a local drug take-back program, flushing it, or throwing it in the household trash - depending on the specific medication. The goal is to empower our community to properly get rid of unused or expired drugs. By providing personalized disposal recommendations, we hope to prevent harmful substances from ending up in landfills, waterways, or the wrong hands. My aim is a solution with a positive impact on the environment and public health. Together, we can find better ways to handle medications safely.
Here's how it works:
Data Processing:
Uses pandas for managing our medication database
Includes chemical compositions and validated disposal methods
Covers common medications from pain relievers to cardiovascular drugs
Feature Engineering:
Implements TF-IDF vectorization to convert chemical formulas into machine-readable features
Captures the unique molecular patterns that influence disposal requirements
Model Architecture:
Employs Logistic Regression for binary classification
Trained on a curated dataset of medication disposal guidelines
Achieves reliable prediction accuracy for disposal recommendations
üåç Impact: 
This tool helps:
Prevent water supply contamination
Reduce the environmental impact of improper medication disposal
Provide easy-to-follow disposal guidance for communities

The next steps include expanding the database and developing a user-friendly interface for community use.
